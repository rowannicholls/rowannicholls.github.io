Installation {.tabset}
============

macOS
-----
On *macOS Sierra, Mojave and Catalina* install Sublime Text from its [download page](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).

Check that it works by opening the terminal (Cmd+Space to open Spotlight Search then search for "terminal") and running:

```bash
sublime --version
```

This should return a build number.

You can open a file in Sublime Text from the terminal with:

```bash
sublime <filename>
```

Ubuntu
------

- *Ubuntu 18.04*
    - Download Sublime Text from the Ubuntu Software app that comes pre-installed with Ubuntu
    - Check that it works by running `subl --version` at the terminal. It should return a build number.
    - *Updating Sublime Text:* It appears that there is a bit of a delay between a new version being released and it being available on snap (Ubuntu Software). When it does become available it gets downloaded automatically, but there will be a period during which every time you open Sublime Text it notifies you that a new version is available. It's annoying but just ignore it until it goes away. Don't try and download the latest version manually because it will try to install a separate version of Sublime parallel to the snap one. That could get complicated, so just leave it.
- *Ubuntu 16.04*
    - Install from the terminal with:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-3
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install sublime-text-installer
    ```

You can open a file in Sublime Text from the terminal with:

```bash
subl <filename>
```

Fedora
------
On *Fedora 22*, install Sublime Text from the terminal with:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo rpm -v --import https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-rpm-pub.gpg
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.sublimetext.com/rpm/stable/x86_64/sublime-text.repo
sudo dnf install sublime-text
```

Open a file in Sublime Text from the terminal with:

```bash
subl <filename>
```

Windows
-------
On *Windows 7, 8 & 10* install Sublime Text from its [download page](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).

You can open a file in Sublime Text from the command prompt with:

```bash
subl.exe <filename>
```

If this doesn't work, it's probably because Sublime Text is not added to your PATH:

- System Properties ðŸ¡’ Advanced System Settings ðŸ¡’ Advanced ðŸ¡’ Environment Variables (or run `sysdm.cpl` from Command Prompt)
- Create a new system variable:
    - Click "New...""
    - Name: `SUBLIME`
    - Value: `C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3`
    - Append to PATH: `;%SUBLIME%`
- Restart Command Prompt

General Sublime Text Configuration
==================================
- If the default behaviour is to open new files in a new window, you can change this so that they open in the same window:
    - Sublime Text ðŸ¡’ Preferences ðŸ¡’ Settings ðŸ¡’ right-hand-side (User settings)
    - Add `"open_files_in_new_window": false`
- *macOS Sierra:*
    - The default behaviour is to add a full stop when space bar is pressed twice. This is a Sierra thing, not a Sublime Text thing.
    - It can be disabled by going to System Preferences ðŸ¡’ Keyboard ðŸ¡’ Text ðŸ¡’ deselect "Add period with double-space" on the right

**If Sublime Text is not in the 'Open With' Menus:**

- *Ubuntu 18.04:*
    - Right-click on a file ðŸ¡’ Open With Other Application ðŸ¡’ Sublime Text
    - This should change the default for this file type so that it will always open with Sublime Text.
    - In reality, this works for some file types but not for others. For these, you need to manually make Sublime Text the default editor.
- *Ubuntu 16.04:*
    - Copy the contents of `/usr/share/applications/sublime_text.desktop` and paste them in here: `~/.local/share/applications/sublime_text.desktop`
    - Then, in the terminal, run:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    sudo update-desktop-database
    ```

**Make Sublime Text the Default Editor:**

- *macOS:*
    - Right-click a file in Finder ðŸ¡’ Get Info ðŸ¡’ under "Open with:" find "Sublime Text" in the dropdown menu ðŸ¡’ click "Change All..." ðŸ¡’ Continue
- *Ubuntu 18.04:*
    - Find "sublime_text.desktop" ("sublime-text.desktop" on some systems):
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    cd /
    sudo find . -name "sublime_text.desktop"
    ```
    - For me it was "./snap/sublime-test/24/opt/sublime_text/sublime_text.desktop"
    - Open the default applications list:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    subl /usr/share/applications/defaults.list
    ```
    - Ctrl+H ðŸ¡’ Find all instances of "gedit" ðŸ¡’ Replace them with "sublime_text"
    - Save the file (you need your sudo password) ðŸ¡’ log out and back in again ðŸ¡’ you should be all set
- *Ubuntu 16.04:*
    - Install Ubuntu Tweak:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:trebelnik-stefina/ubuntu-tweak
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ubuntu-tweak
    ```
    - "Admins" tab ðŸ¡’ "File Type Manager" section ðŸ¡’ "Text" category from the left side bar ðŸ¡’ click on the "Associated Application" column to sort it by Application name ðŸ¡’ select the top entry with gedit, then Press and hold the Shift key and click on the last entry with gedit. Then click on the "Edit: button ðŸ¡’ select the desired application from they list and click "close"
- *Fedora 22:*
    - Right-click on a file ðŸ¡’ Properties ðŸ¡’ Open With ðŸ¡’ select "Sublime Text" ðŸ¡’ Set as default
- *Windows 8:*
    - Right-click on a file ðŸ¡’ Open with ðŸ¡’ choose default program

Dictionaries
============
Turn spell check on by pressing F6 (Fn+F6 on macOS).

**Add Words to the Dictionary:**

- Go to Preferences ðŸ¡’ Settings (on macOS there is a keyboard shortcut: Cmd+Comma)
- This opens up your preferences file which, for the record, is located here:
    - *macOS:* `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings`
    - *Linux:* `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings`
- Add words to an `"added_words"` section in the JSON User Settings file on the right-hand-side, for example:
```{json}
{
	"added_words":
	[
		"covid",
		"furloughed",
		"lockdown"
	]
}
```
- To alphabetise this list, select the lines and go Edit ðŸ¡’ Sort Lines (shortcut: F9, or Fn+F9 on macOS)
- Hint: it's worthwhile creating a backup of your user preferences file. Then, when you next install Sublime Text on a new computer you can just paste your old preferences in.

**Installing Other Dictionaries:**

- Go to https://github.com/titoBouzout/Dictionaries
- Download as a zip file ðŸ¡’ unzip it ðŸ¡’ rename the folder "Dictionaries"
- In Sublime Text, go to Preferences ðŸ¡’ Browse Packages...
- The Packages folder will open up
- Move your new "Dictionaries" folder here
- In Sublime Text, choose the language (eg View ðŸ¡’ Dictionaries ðŸ¡’ German)
- Be sure Spell Check is activated (F6 or View ðŸ¡’ Spell Check)

Insert Unicode Characters
=========================
- *macOS Catalina:*
    - Press Ctrl+Cmd+Space to bring up the character input box
    - Either manually search for the symbol you want and select it, or start typing to search by the characters' names
    - Frustratingly, you can't search for Unicode sequences, so to get the poop emoji (ðŸ’©) you need to search "poop" as opposed to "1f4a9" or "u+1f4a9"
- *macOS Sierra:*
    - There's no simple way to do this via keyboard shortcuts. The complicated way is as follows:
    - Go to System Preferences ðŸ¡’ Keyboard ðŸ¡’ Input Sources
    - Enable Unicode Hex Input
    - Each time you want to input a Unicode character:
        - Switch to the Unicode hex input system. The default keyboard binding for this (Cmd+Space) conflicts with Spotlight Search, so you would need to change it to something different.
        - Hold Alt
        - Type the utf-16 hex code (which is different to the Unicode code) corresponding to the Unicode character: eg Alt+D, 8, 3, D, D, C, A, 9 will give you Mr Poopy (U+1F4A9): ðŸ’©
- *Linux:*
    - Ctrl+Shift+U, &lt;Unicode sequence&gt;, Space
    - For Mr Poopy, it's Ctrl+Shift+U, 1, F, 4, A, 9, Space: ðŸ’©
