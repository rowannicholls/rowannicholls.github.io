### 20.04 and 22.04

**1. Install LaTeX**

Before you can use LaTeX in Sublime Text you need to have it installed on your computer:

- Option 1: install TexStudio (which will install LaTeX as well). This can be downloaded from [here](https://www.texstudio.org/) or from within the Ubuntu Software app (aka the Snap Store).
- Option 2: install it from the terminal with:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ sudo apt install texlive-latex-base
```

You can check that it has worked by running the following in the terminal:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ latex --version
$ pdflatex --version
$ lualatex --version
$ bibtex --version
```

Each of the above should return a block of text with version, author and license information.

Another way to check that it has worked is to actually create and compile a document:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ echo '\documentclass{article}\begin{document}Hello, World!\end{document}' > test.tex
$ pdflatex test.tex
```

Next, install some extra things that are missing from the base LaTeX installation:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ sudo apt install dvipng
$ sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra
$ sudo apt install texlive-fonts-recommended
$ sudo apt install texlive-pictures
$ sudo apt install texlive-extra-utils
$ sudo apt install magick
$ sudo apt install texlive-font-utils  # Needed for eps figures to work
$ sudo apt install latexmk  # Needed for running LaTeX in Sublime Text
$ sudo apt install texlive-lang-greek  # Needed for the textgreek package
$ sudo apt install cm-super  # Needed for using LaTeX in Matplotlib plot labels
```

**2. Install the Sublime Text Extensions for LaTeX**

Specifically, install the **LaTeXTools** package for Sublime Text:

- Tools > Command Palette (keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+P) > Package Control: Install Package > LaTeXTools
- Close and re-open Sublime Text after the installation is finished
- To read the help manual, go to: Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeXTools > Documentation

Check that it has worked by opening a LaTeX file (one with the `.tex` extension) in Sublime Text and compiling it:

- If the `.tex` file doesn't open in Sublime Text:
    - Open it this one time in Sublime Text by right-clicking on it > Open With Other Application > select Sublime Text (go to View All Applications to find it if it isn't there)
    - To set this as the default behaviour for `.tex` files, right-click > Properties (keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+I) > Open With > select Sublime Text > Set as default
- Once open in Sublime Text, building the file via Tools > Build (keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+B) should produce a PDF file
- If this doesn't work, it might be because Sublime Text has not yet associated `.tex` files with LaTeX. Go to Tools > Build System > LaTeX and try to Build it again. If this works, remember to change the Build System back to automatic (Tools > Build System > Automatic).
- If this still doesn't work, go to Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeXTools > Check System. It's fine if `xelatex` and `biber` are missing and if `display_log` is false, but everything else should be there and be green.

Note that if you have a bibliography you need to copy the bibstyle file (eg `apa.bst`) into the working directory.

To see all the keyboard shortcuts that will work when a `.tex` file is open and active, go to Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeXTools > Key Bindings - Default. Probably the most useful is the shortcut that will display the word count: Ctrl+L, W

**3. Installing LaTeX Packages**

- Go to [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/) > search for and download the package you want
- It will either download as a `.sty` file or as a `.zip` file. If the latter, unzip it and run LaTeX on the `.ins` file which will create the `.sty` file:
    + Unzip it by double-clicking on it > Extract > Extract > Close > Close
    + In a terminal, `cd` into the unzipped folder and run:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ latex {package_name}.ins
    ```
    - Follow any advice printed to the terminal, eg it might detail how to produce the documentation
- Move the `.sty` file to the following directory: `/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex`. This can be done with:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ sudo mv {package_name}.sty /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/{package_name}.sty
```
- Update the ls-R file in this source tree. Because the folder you moved the `.sty` file into might not be searched by default, the ls-R file must be updated to make the system aware of the new package:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ sudo mktexlsr
```

Check that it has worked by opening a LaTeX file and adding `\usepackage{}` to the preamble with your new package's name between the curly brackets and compiling it.

### 16.04 and 18.04

**Install LaTeX:**

- Install TeXLive (from https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html, not via Terminal!):
    + Download and unpack the .tar.gz
    + Help: https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html
    + Open Terminal and cd into the unpacked `install-tl-*` folder
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    sudo su
    ./install-tl
    i
    PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
    apt-get install latexmk
    ```
- Install extra things that aren't in TexLive:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get -y install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-pictures texlive-latex-extra
```

Also install ImageMagick:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ wget https://www.imagemagick.org/download/ImageMagick.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf ImageMagick.tar.gz
$ cd ImageMagick-7.0.x-xx/  # Replace the "x"s with the right version numbers
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
```

**Once finished:**

- In Sublime Text, go to Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeXTools > Check System
    - `xelatex` and `biber` might be missing and `display_log` might be false, but everything else should be there and be green
- Test that it works:
    - Open a LaTeX file and compile it with the build system (Tools > Build System > LaTeX)
    - Compile it via Ctrl+C+B (the key binding doesn't work until you've made the association between the tex file and the LaTeX build system which happens when you run it via Tools > Build System > LaTeX)
- If you have a bibliography, you need to copy the bibstyle file (eg apa.bst) into the working directory
- For more key bindings, see Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeX Tools > Key Bindings-Default
    - eg Ctrl+L,W for word count
- To turn off the "NO BIB FILE" Warning:
    - Place cursor in an open .tex file
    - Ctrl+L,T,A,C (ie press Ctrl+L, then press t, then press a, then press c)

Windows
-------
*On Windows 7, 8 and 10:*

- Before you can use LaTeX in Sublime Text, you need to have it installed on your computer. One option is to install the "TexStudio" programme as this will install LaTeX as well. It can be downloaded from [here](https://www.texstudio.org/).
- Make sure it is working by running a LaTeX file and ensure you know how to install packages (hint: TexStudio does it automatically).
- Install the LaTeXTools package for Sublime Text:
    - Command Palette > Package Control: Install Package > LaTeXTools
    - Close and re-open Sublime Text after the installation is finished
    - Help: Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeXTools > Documentation
- Install Sumatra PDF (https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html)
- You can now compile TeX files that are open in Sublime Text into PDFs by pressing Ctrl+C+B.
