Prerequisites {.tabset}
=============
- You must have Latex installed already (eg by installing TexStudio, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.texstudio.org/)). Make sure it is working by running a Latex file and ensure you know how to install packages (hint: TexStudio does it automatically).
- You must have the LaTeXTools package for Sublime Text installed:
    - Command Palette ðŸ¡’ Package Control: Install Package ðŸ¡’ LaTeXTools
    - Close and re-open Sublime Text after the installation is finished
    - Help: Preferences ðŸ¡’ Package Settings ðŸ¡’ LaTeXTools ðŸ¡’ Documentation

Ubuntu
------
*On Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04:*

- Install TeXLive (from https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html, not via Terminal!):
    + Download and unpack the .tar.gz
    + Help: https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html
    + Open Terminal and cd into the unpacked `install-tl-*` folder
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    sudo su
    ./install-tl
    i
    PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
    apt-get install latexmk
    ```
- Install extra things that aren't in TexLive:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get -y install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-pictures texlive-latex-extra
```
- In Sublime Text, go to Preferences ðŸ¡’ Package Settings ðŸ¡’ LaTeXTools ðŸ¡’ Check System
    - `xelatex` and `biber` might be missing and `display_log` might be false, but everything else should be there and be green
- Test that it works:
    - Open a Latex file and compile it with the build system (Tools ðŸ¡’ Build System ðŸ¡’ LaTeX)
    - Compile it via Ctrl+C+B (the key binding doesn't work until you've made the association between the tex file and the Latex build system which happens when you run it via Tools ðŸ¡’ Build System ðŸ¡’ LaTeX)
- If you have a bibliography, you need to copy the bibstyle file (eg apa.bst) into the working directory
- For more key bindings, see Preferences ðŸ¡’ Package Settings ðŸ¡’ LaTeX Tools ðŸ¡’ Key Bindings-Default
    - eg Ctrl+L,W for word count
- To turn off the "NO BIB FILE" Warning:
    - Place cursor in an open .tex file
    - Ctrl-L,T,A,C (ie press Ctrl+L, then press t, then press a, then press c)

Windows
-------
*On Windows 7, 8 and 10:*

- Must have Sumatra PDF installed (https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html)
- Compile: Ctrl+C+B
