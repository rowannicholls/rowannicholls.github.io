Ubuntu
------

*On Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04:*

**Prerequisites**

- Before you can use LaTeX in Sublime Text you need to have it installed on your computer:
    - Option 1: install TexStudio (which will install LaTeX as well). This can be downloaded from [here](https://www.texstudio.org/) or from within the Ubuntu Software app (aka the Snap Store).
    - Option 2: install it from the terminal with:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base
    ```
- Make sure it is working by running a LaTeX file and ensure you know how to install packages (hint: TexStudio does it automatically).
- Install the LaTeXTools package for Sublime Text:
    - Tools > Command Palette (shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+P) > Package Control: Install Package > LaTeXTools
    - Close and re-open Sublime Text after the installation is finished
    - To get help, go to: Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeXTools > Documentation

- Install extra things from the terminal with:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt install dvipng
sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra
sudo apt install texlive-fonts-recommended
sudo apt install texlive-pictures
sudo apt install texlive-font-utils  # Needed for eps figures to work
sudo apt install latexmk  # Needed for running LaTeX in Sublime Text
sudo apt install texlive-lang-greek
sudo apt install texlive-extra-utils
```

- Then install ImageMagick with:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://www.imagemagick.org/download/ImageMagick.tar.gz
tar xvzf ImageMagick.tar.gz
cd ImageMagick-7.0.x-xx/  # Replace the "x"s with the right version numbers
./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
```

- Check it has worked with `magick -version`

*On Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04:*

- Install TeXLive (from https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html, not via Terminal!):
    + Download and unpack the .tar.gz
    + Help: https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html
    + Open Terminal and cd into the unpacked `install-tl-*` folder
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    sudo su
    ./install-tl
    i
    PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
    apt-get install latexmk
    ```
- Install extra things that aren't in TexLive:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get -y install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-pictures texlive-latex-extra
```

**Once finished:**

- In Sublime Text, go to Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeXTools > Check System
    - `xelatex` and `biber` might be missing and `display_log` might be false, but everything else should be there and be green
- Test that it works:
    - Open a LaTeX file and compile it with the build system (Tools > Build System > LaTeX)
    - Compile it via Ctrl+C+B (the key binding doesn't work until you've made the association between the tex file and the LaTeX build system which happens when you run it via Tools > Build System > LaTeX)
- If you have a bibliography, you need to copy the bibstyle file (eg apa.bst) into the working directory
- For more key bindings, see Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeX Tools > Key Bindings-Default
    - eg Ctrl+L,W for word count
- To turn off the "NO BIB FILE" Warning:
    - Place cursor in an open .tex file
    - Ctrl-L,T,A,C (ie press Ctrl+L, then press t, then press a, then press c)

Windows
-------
*On Windows 7, 8 and 10:*

- Before you can use LaTeX in Sublime Text, you need to have it installed on your computer. One option is to install the "TexStudio" programme as this will install LaTeX as well. It can be downloaded from [here](https://www.texstudio.org/).
- Make sure it is working by running a LaTeX file and ensure you know how to install packages (hint: TexStudio does it automatically).
- Install the LaTeXTools package for Sublime Text:
    - Command Palette > Package Control: Install Package > LaTeXTools
    - Close and re-open Sublime Text after the installation is finished
    - Help: Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeXTools > Documentation
- Install Sumatra PDF (https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html)
- You can now compile TeX files that are open in Sublime Text into PDFs by pressing Ctrl+C+B.
