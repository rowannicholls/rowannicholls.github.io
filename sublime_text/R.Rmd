Setup {.tabset}
=====

macOS
-----
- Create an R Build System by creating a new Sublime-Build file:
    - Sublime-Build files tell Sublime Text how you want to run a script when you hit Ctrl+B
    - Tools ðŸ¡’ Build System ðŸ¡’ New Build System...
    - In the "untitled.sublime-build" that appears, replace everything with
    ```{json}
    {
        "cmd"       : ["Rscript", "$file"],
        "selector"  : "source.shell",
    }
    ```
- Save as "R.sublime-build" in the default location (which, on macOS, is `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`)
- Run R files with Ctrl+B

Ubuntu
------
+ Once R has been installed (`sudo apt-get install r-base`) it works in Sublime Text with Ctrl+B
- If the R-IDE package is installed (it is needed if you want to work with R Markdown) this behaviour changes (the default build system becomes R-IDE and its 'Exec' function). To fix this, go to Tools ðŸ¡’ Build With... and select "R" to re-teach Sublime Text what build system should be used as the automatic one.
