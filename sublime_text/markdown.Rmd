Packages to Install
===================
Install the following packages one-by-one via Command Palette (Shift+Ctrl+P, or Shift+Cmd+P on macOS) > search for "Package Control: Install Package" > search for each package in turn. Close and re-open Sublime Text after each one finishes installing.

- **MarkdownEditing**
    - A general Markdown plugin. The main thing it doesn't include is a build system (the MarkdownPreview package has this, though).
    + *Note:* this package introduces a key binding conflict as it overwrites Ctrl+1/2/3. This isn't an issue if you don't use those bindings, but if you do then create a [user key binding](key_bindings.html) (see below) to fix it.
    - To change the colour scheme of Markdown text windows:
        - Have the window with the undesirable colour scheme active
        - Preferences > Settings - Syntax Specific > add the following into the 'User' settings (left-hand side):
        ```json
        {
            "extensions":
            [
                "md"
            ],
            "color_scheme": "Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Monokai.tmTheme",
            "save_on_focus_lost": true,
            "line_numbers": true,
            "translate_tabs_to_spaces": false
        }
        ```
    - If it starts to think that .txt files are Markdown file, open a .txt file (ie have that window active) and go: View > Syntax > Open all with current extension as... > your syntax choice
- **MarkdownPreview**
    - View rendered Markdown in your browser
    - Allows you to create an HTML file from a Markdown file by pressing Ctrl+B/Cmd+B
    - You can create a [user key binding](key_bindings.html) (see below) to immediately open the current Markdown file as a rendered HTML page in your web browser
- **Markdown Table Formatter**
    - Easily align columns in Markdown tables
    - Default key binding: Shift+Ctrl+Alt+T

Key Bindings
============
To create custom key bindings, go to Preferences > Key Bindings and edit the right-hand-side, eg by entering the following:

```json
[
    /* Markdown */
    // Render Markdown in browser
    { "keys": ["shift+alt+m"], "command": "markdown_preview", "args": {"target": "browser", "parser": "markdown"} },
    // Overwrite MardownEditing's key bindings
    { "keys": ["ctrl+1"], "command": "focus_group", "args": { "group": 0 } },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+2"], "command": "focus_group", "args": { "group": 1 } },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+3"], "command": "focus_group", "args": { "group": 2 } },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+4"], "command": "focus_group", "args": { "group": 3 } },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+5"], "command": "focus_group", "args": { "group": 4 } },
]
```

- The first key binding created above is "Shift-Alt-M" which, when activated while a Markdown file is open and in focus (ie your caret is in the Markdown file, not a different file that is open), will render that file and display it in your browser
- The other five key bindings created above merely override the conflict created by the MarkdownEditing package
- Markdown Table Formatter uses "Shift+Ctrl+Alt+T"

Troubleshooting
===============

'No Build System'
-----------------
If you try to build a Markdown file (if you have an .md file open and either press Ctrl+B/Cmd+B or go Tools > Build) and it doesn't work, take a look at the bottom left corner. If it has the message "No build system" then take a look in the Tools > Build System menu. If that contains "Markdown" then it means that Sublime Text has a problem with the *syntax highlighting* (color scheme), not the build system. You can double check this by looking in the View > Syntax menu (or at the bottom right corner where the detected syntax is shown - clicking on this will being up the same menu) and seeing that "Markdown" does not exist.

Fix this problem by uninstalling and re-installing the **MarkdownEditing** package:

- Tools > Command Palette... (Ctrl+Shift+P/Cmd+Shift+P) > search for "Package Control: Remove Package" > search for "MarkdownEditing"
- Once uninstalled, do the reverse (searching the Command Palette for "Package Control: Install Package")

Rendering Maths
===============
How to have Latex equations in your Markdown be rendered by Markdown Preview in Sublime Text:

- Open the Markdown Preview Package Settings:
    - *macOS:* Menu bar > Sublime Text > Preferences > Package Settings > Markdown Preview > Settings
    - *Linux/Windows:* Preferences > Package Settings > Markdown Preview > Settings
- In the User settings (on the right-hand side), you need to add two things:
	- JavaScript settings to point Sublime Text to information about MathJax:
    ```json
    {
        "js": [
            "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js",
            "res://MarkdownPreview/js/math_config.js",
        ]
    }
    ```
	- Markdown extension settings to enable Arithmatex:
    ```json
    {
        "markdown_extensions": [
            {
                "pymdownx.arithmatex": {
                    "generic": true
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
- If you do this and stop at this point you will be able to render equations but tables will no longer work! This is because you will have overwritten ALL the `markdown_extensions` settings when enabling Arithmatex. To avoid this you need to manually enable them all again: find `markdown_extensions` in the Default settings (on the left-hand side) and copy-paste that section into the User settings (on the right-hand side).
- Your complete User settings will now look like this:
```json
{
    "js": [
        "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js",
        "res://MarkdownPreview/js/math_config.js",
    ],
    "markdown_extensions": [
        {
            "pymdownx.arithmatex": {
                "generic": true
            }
        },
        // Python Markdown Extra with SuperFences.
        // You can't include "extra" and "superfences"
        // as "fenced_code" can not be included with "superfences",
        // so we include the pieces separately.

                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### More details:
Markdown Preview uses MathJax to turn LaTeX equations into HTML. The settings for how this works are contained in two files:

- The **MathJax JavaScript configuration file** that gets installed by default when you install the Markdown Preview package. This is hidden on your system so it can't be opened normally (even if you un-hide hidden files or search for it in the terminal) so use the PackageResourceViewer package:
    - Install it via Command Palette > search for "Package Control: Install Package" > search for "PackageResourceViewer"
    - Use it via Command Palette > search for "PackageResourceViewer: Open Resource" > MarkdownPreview > js/ > math_config.js
- The **Markdown Preview Package User Settings**
    + This is the file mentioned above under "Rendering Maths"
    - This file does not exist when Markdown Preview is first installed (and if you are happy with how Markdown Preview works then that is fine)
    - If you *do* want to change how Markdown Preview works, this file can be created (and subsequently edited) from inside Sublime Text:
        - *Linux:* Preferences > Package Settings > Markdown Preview > Settings
        - The right-hand side file contains the user settings (this file is editable) while the left-hand side one has the default settings (this file is not editable but these settings get overridden by the user settings)
    - For reference, once this user settings file has been created it will be located here:
        - *macOS:* `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/User/MarkdownPreview.sublime-settings`
        - *Linux:* `/home/<username>/.config/sublime-text/Packages/User/MarkdownPreview.sublime-settings`
