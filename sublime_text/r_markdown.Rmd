To render R Markdown:

- The R-IDE and LSP packages need to be installed in Sublime Text:
    - Command Palette > Package Control: Install Package > R-IDE
    - Command Palette > Package Control: Install Package > LSP
- Render with R-IDE to check that it works:
    - Open an .Rmd file
    - From the menu bar: R-IDE > Render R Markdown
- Create an R Markdown build system:
    - Tools > Build System > New Build System...
    - In the "untitled.sublime-build" that appears, replace everything with:
    ```json
    {
        "cmd"       : ["Rscript", "-e", "rmarkdown::render('$file')"],
        "selector"  : "source.shell",
    }
    ```
    - Save as "Rmarkdown.sublime-build" in the default location. For the record, the default locations are:
        - *Ubuntu:* `/home/<username>/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User`
        - *macOS:* `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`
- Render with the Build System:
    - Open an .Rmd file
    - From the menu bar: Tools > Build With...
    - From then on you can just build with Ctrl+B/Cmd+B as the default build system will have been set when you used "Build With..."
