To render R Markdown documents that are open in Sublime Text:

Pre-Requisites
==============
- You need to have **R** installed on your computer
    + *Ubuntu:* you can do this from the terminal with `sudo apt install r-base-core`
    + *macOS:* download RStudio from [its website](https://posit.co/downloads/)
    + Check that it's worked from the terminal with `R --version`
- You also need to have the R package **rmarkdown** installed. This can be done by opening R (eg by running `R` in the terminal) and running `install.packages("rmarkdown")`
- If you will be running Python chunks in your R Markdown files you will need to have the **reticulate** package as well: `install.packages("reticulate")`
- **Pandoc** must also be installed. Get this from [its website](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) or via the terminal (`sudo apt-get install pandoc`).
    + Check that you have it from the terminal with `pandoc --version`
- The **R-IDE** and **LSP** packages need to be installed in Sublime Text:
    - Command Palette > Package Control: Install Package > R-IDE
    - Command Palette > Package Control: Install Package > LSP

Usage
=====
- To start with - just to check that it works - use R-IDE to render an R Markdown file:
    - Open an .Rmd file in Sublime Text
    - From the menu bar: R-IDE > Render R Markdown
    - This should cause a file to be created. The file type of this output will depend on what option was set with the `output` parameter in the .Rmd file's YAML configuration, eg `output: html_document` will give you an HTMl file.
- Now check to see if you can do this rendering by invoking a Sublime Text "Build System":
    + From the menu bar: Tools > Build. The keyboard shortcut for this is Ctrl+B (*Ubuntu/Windows*) or Cmd+B (*macOS*).
    + If this doesn't work, you will need to create a Build System manually:

**Creating an R Markdown Build System Manually**

- From the menu bar: Tools > Build System > New Build System...
- In the "untitled.sublime-build" file that appears, replace everything with:
```{json}
{
    "cmd"       : ["Rscript", "-e", "rmarkdown::render('$file')"],
    "selector"  : "source.shell, source.Rmd",
}
```
- Save as "Rmarkdown.sublime-build" in the default location. For the record, these default locations are:
    - *Ubuntu:* `/home/<username>/.config/sublime-text/Packages/User`
    - *macOS:* `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 4/Packages/User`
- Render with the Build System:
    - Open an .Rmd file
    - From the menu bar: Tools > Build With...
    - From then on you can just build with Ctrl+B/Cmd+B as the default build system will have been set when you used "Build With..."
