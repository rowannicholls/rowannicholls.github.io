What is a Dictionary in Python?
===============================
It's an **object that stores information in the same way that a dictionary stores words and their definitions**. Here's an example of an *English dictionary* created using a *dictionary object* in Python:

```{python}
# Create a dictionary
my_dictionary = {
    'Apple': 'A fruit that grows on trees',
    'Ball': 'Another name for a spherical object',
    'Cart': 'Platform with wheels pulled by an animal',
}
```

In the above snippet we have:

- **A variable** called `my_dictionary`
- **Curly brackets** - `{}` - which are the symbols used by Python to show the start and end of a dictionary object
- **Keys**, which is the proper name for the *words* being defined
- **Values**, which is the proper name for the *definitions* of those words
- **Colons** - `:` - which separate the keys and the values to create *key-value pairs* (or *items*) in your dictionary
- **Commas**, which separate the key-value pairs. Note that the comma after the last key-value pair is optional.

These are the necessary components for creating a dictionary.

> Essentially, a dictionary is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs inside of curly brackets

Using a Dictionary
==================
You **index** a dictionary (look up a value) by using square brackets and the relevant key:

```{python}
# Look up the definition of 'apple'
print(my_dictionary['Apple'])
```

You can add items into a dictionary by *indexing it* with a new key and *assigning* a value to it:

```{python}
# Add a new word and definition to the dictionary
my_dictionary['Python'] = 'A type of snake'

print(my_dictionary['Python'])
```

> Remember, an *item* is a *key* plus a *value*

Overwriting a value works in a similar way: index the dictionary with an *existing* key and assign a new value to it. The old value will be replaced:

```{python}
# Replace the definition of the word 'Python'
my_dictionary['Python'] = 'A type of programming language'

print(my_dictionary['Python'])
```

The fact that the above code overwrites the value implies that *keys must be unique* - you can't have two `Python` keys in the same dictionary.

To **del**ete an item, use the `del` statement:

```{python}
# Remove the word 'Ball' and its definition
del my_dictionary['Ball']

print(my_dictionary)
```

Data Types
==========
The **keys** in a dictionary can be *strings, numbers or tuples* (or a combination of these):

```{python}
# A dictionary with strings as keys
animal_types = {'Lion': 'Mammal', 'Bear': 'Mammal', 'Crocodile': 'Reptile', 'Eagle': 'Bird', 'Pigeon': 'Bird'}

print(animal_types['Lion'])
```

```{python}
# A dictionary with numbers as keys
arabic_to_roman = {1: 'I', 2: 'II', 3: 'III', 4: 'IV', 5: 'V', 6: 'VI'}

print(arabic_to_roman[2])
```

```{python}
# A dictionary with tuples as keys
days_in_month = {('Nov', 2021): 30, ('Dec', 2021): 31, ('Jan', 2022): 31, ('Feb', 2022): 28, ('Mar', 2022): 31}

print(days_in_month[('Mar', 2022)])
```

```{python}
# A dictionary with a combination of strings, numbers and tuples as keys
dct = {'A': 'Alfa', 1: 'Bravo', (2, 'C'): 'Charlie'}

print(dct[(2, 'C')])
```

> You can't have lists as keys because they are mutable (they can be modified in-place) which confuses Python

Of course, a key can be stored in a variable:

```{python}
# Assign a key to a variable
var = 'A'
# Index a dictionary with the variable
print(dct[var])
```

The **values** in a dictionary can be *any* data type:

```{python}
dct = {
    'String': 'Alpha',
    'Number': 1,
    'Null': None,
    'Boolean': True,
    'List': [1, 2, 3, 4, 'Five', 'Six'],
    'Dictionary': {'A': 'Alfa', 'B': 'Bravo', 'C': 'Charlie'},
    'Tuple': (0, 'A'),
}
```

This implies that the values can be treated like their data types; for example, if a value is a list then all the methods that work on lists will work on the indexed dictionary.

```{python}
# Augment a string
dct['String'] = dct['String'] + 'bet'
# Add to a number
dct['Number'] = dct['Number'] + 9
# Test equality
dct['Boolean'] = dct['Boolean'] == 'Value'
# Append to a list
dct['List'].append(3)
# Add to a dictionary within a dictionary
dct['Dictionary']['D'] = 'Delta'
# Slice a tuple
dct['Tuple'] = dct['Tuple'][1:]

print(dct)
```

This can get as complex as you want:

```{python}
# Use list comprehension, list indexing and a variable as the key
key = 'List'
idx = 4
dct[key] = dct[key][:idx] + [x + 4 for x in dct[key][:idx]]

print(dct['List'])
```

Information About a Dictionary
==============================
The **len**gth of a dictionary is the number of items inside it:

```{python}
dct = {'A': 'Alfa', 'B': 'Bravo', 'C': 'Charlie'}

print(len(dct))
```

The `.keys()` method returns all the keys as a 'dict_keys' object:

```{python}
print(dct.keys())
```

It is usually useful to convert this into a list:

```{python}
print(list(dct.keys()))
```

Similarly, the `.values()` method will return all the values:

```{python}
all_values = dct.values()
all_values = list(all_values)
print(all_values)
```

Lastly, the `.items()` method will return all of the items:

```{python}
all_values = dct.items()
all_values = list(all_values)
print(all_values)
```

Notice that the `list()` function converted the dictionary items into a list of tuples. This means that all the key-value pairs can be iterated over, in order, using a 'for' loop:

```{python}
for key, value in dct.items():
    print(key, value)
```

Initialising a Dictionary
=========================
Of course, a dictionary can be empty! Create an empty dictionary by simply not putting anything inside the curly brackets:

```{python}
dct = {}
```

An empty dictionary can be useful for when you need the object to be *initialised* for something that happens downstream. Maybe there's a loop that populates a dictionary and thus requires one to exist before it starts:

```{python}
dct = {}
for day in ['Mon', 'Tues', 'Wednes', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Satur', 'Sun']:
    dct[day] = day + 'day'

print(dct)
```

Another way to create an empty dictionary is by using the `dict()` function with no arguments:

```{python}
dct = dict()
```

Python actually uses the name **dict** instead of 'dictionary' for the object type:

```{python}
print(type(dct))
```

Note that an empty dictionary is not the same as a dictionary that contains an empty list or a null:

```{python}
# Not an empty dictionary
dct['Value 1'] = []
dct['Value 2'] = None
```

If it contains an empty list or a null it still contains something!

Conversion to Named Values
==========================
What's a "named value"? These are most easily explained by using an example: consider the `pow()` function in Python which raises a number to a **pow**er:

```{python}
# Raise a number to a power
x = pow(10, 2)

print(x)
```

This has calculated $10^2 = 100$. The `pow()` function raises a **base** to an **exp**onent. As it happens, this function names its inputs - the first is given the name "base" and the second is called "exp" - which means you can specify the arguments by their names:

```{python}
# Raise a base to an exponent
x = pow(base=10, exp=2)

print(x)
```

This is what is meant by "named values", it literally refers to values which have names! Of course, dictionaries consist of key-value pairs which associate names to values, but they are not quite the same. Fortunately, there is a way to convert dictionaries to named values: the double-asterisk operator:

```{python}
# Create a dictionary
dct = {'base': 10, 'exp': 2}
# Use the dictionary as the input arguments to the pow() function
x = pow(**dct)

print(x)
```

What's happened here is that the two asterisks have converted the two key-value pairs in the dictionary into two named values called "base" (with a value of 10) and "exp" (with a value of 2) which have then been used as named arguments for the `pow()` function.

Merge Two Dictionaries
======================
Another use for named values is when you want to merge two dictionaries:

```{python}
# Results of the men's 400m finals at the last two Olympic Games
rio2016 = {'Wayde van Niekerk': 1, 'Kirani James': 2, 'LaShawn Merritt': 3}
tokyo2020 = {'Steven Gardiner': 1, 'Anthony Zambrano': 2, 'Kirani James': 3}

# Merge the two dictionaries to get the athletes' most recent finishing positions
most_recent = {**rio2016, **tokyo2020}

print(most_recent)
```

Notice that when there are duplicate keys the value from the second dictionary overwrites the first: Kirani James came 2nd in Rio and 3rd in Tokyo, so the merged dictionary only keeps his most recent result.

Alternatively, as of Python 3.9, the 'bar' notation can be used to merge one dictionary into another:

```{python}
rio2016 = {'Wayde van Niekerk': 1, 'Kirani James': 2, 'LaShawn Merritt': 3}
tokyo2020 = {'Steven Gardiner': 1, 'Anthony Zambrano': 2, 'Kirani James': 3}
most_recent = rio2016 | tokyo2020

print(most_recent)
```

Or, the `.update()` method can be used to merge *in-place*:

```{python}
results = {'Wayde van Niekerk': 1, 'Kirani James': 2, 'LaShawn Merritt': 3}
new_results = {'Steven Gardiner': 1, 'Anthony Zambrano': 2, 'Kirani James': 3}
results.update(new_results)

print(results)
```

Display a Dictionary as a Formatted Table
=========================================
The `tabulate` package allows you to render a dictionary as a nice table:

```{python}
from tabulate import tabulate

print(tabulate(results.items(), headers=['Name', 'Ranking'], tablefmt='pipe'))
```

Install this package from the terminal with `pip3 install tabulate`.

A More Advanced Type of List?
=============================
**Lists** and **dictionaries** are two different data types in Python. Let's compare them:

```{python}
my_dictionary = {0: 'Alfa', 1: 'Bravo', 2: 'Charlie', 3: 'Delta', 4: 'Echo'}
my_list = ['Alfa', 'Bravo', 'Charlie', 'Delta', 'Echo']
```

A dictionary is defined with curly brackets and contains key-value pairs whereas a list is defined with square brackets and contains only values. A list is indexed with numbers that correspond to the positions of the values whereas a dictionary is indexed with keys (which can be numbers too, or they can be strings or tuples) that correspond to the values:

```{python}
print(my_dictionary[2])
```

```{python}
print(my_list[2])
```

A dictionary is **ordered** just like a list is. This means that its items appear in the same order as they were created/added to the dictionary:

```{python}
print(list(my_dictionary.values())[2])
```

The implication is that dictionaries have two properties that lists do not:

1) You can index dictionaries with numbers that do not correspond to the positions of the items. For example, you can essentially create a list that starts with 1 instead of 0!

```{python}
my_dictionary = {1: 'Alfa', 2: 'Bravo', 3: 'Charlie', 4: 'Delta', 5: 'Echo'}

print(my_dictionary[2])
```

Using the index "2" has returned the second item in the dictionary! You can, of course, not have the numerical indexes be sequential at all if you so wanted.

2) You can index dictionaries with strings **or** numbers:

```{python}
my_dictionary = {'A': 'Alfa', 'B': 'Bravo', 'C': 'Charlie', 'D': 'Delta', 'E': 'Echo'}

print(my_dictionary['B'])
```

```{python}
print(list(my_dictionary.values())[1])
```

For the record, you can always **convert a list into a dictionary** by *enumerating* it (assigning a number to each value):

```{python}
# Convert a list into a dictionary
dct = dict(enumerate(my_list))

print(dct)
```

And, finally, just like you can have lists-of-lists and list comprehensions, you can have dictionaries-of-dictionaries and dictionary comprehensions! See [this page](../advanced/dictionaries.html) for more on those...
