f-Strings are a way of **f**ormatting your **strings**. It's not the only way to do this in Python, but it's the most powerful.

Creating an f-String
====================
An f-string is created by appending the letter "f" to the front of a string and then adding the name of an already-defined variable between curly bracket. The value of that variable will then get incorporated into the string itself.

```{python}
answer = 10
print(f'The answer is {answer}')
```

Multiple arguments can be incorporated into an f-string, and these can be either numbers or strings:

```{python}
first = 47
second = 'hi'
print(f'First argument: {first}, second one: {second}')
```

Adding an equals sign will print the variable name as well (which is useful for debugging):

```{python}
foo = 81
bar = 'hello'
print(f'First argument: {foo=}, second one: {bar=}')
```

For simple variables, an f-string is identical to just printing two things side-by-side:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
answer = 10
# A normal string literal
print('The answer is', answer)
# An f-string
print(f'The answer is {answer}')
```

```
## The answer is 10
## The answer is 10
```

However, for more complicated examples, f-strings will start to get more convenient than just printing. Let's take a closer look at how to use them:

Formatting Numbers
==================
If you print a number using an f-string without any formatting it might not always look good:

```{python}
answer = 1/3
print(f'Very long answer: {answer}')
```

To fix this, you'll first need to choose a number **format** followed by **width** and **decimal place** options:

Number Formats
--------------
A first step to having better-looking numerical outputs is to format your numbers using one of the following built-in options:

- Decimal (d): can only be used when your variable is a whole number
- Fixed-point (f): show the decimal point in your number
- Exponential (e): put the number into exponential notation: have one digit before the decimal point then specify how many powers of ten to multiply it by
- General (g): either fixed-point (f) or exponential (e) format will be used - whichever Python thinks is more appropriate - and trailing zeros will get removed
- Percentage (%): multiplies your variable by 100 and adds a percent sign

A formatting option is used by placing a colon immediately after the variable name followed by the character corresponding to your chosen option:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
answer = 123
print(f'd = decimal:     {answer:d}')
answer = 123.123
print(f'f = fixed-point: {answer:f}')
print(f'e = exponential: {answer:e}')
print(f'g = general:     {answer:g}')
print(f'% = percentage:  {answer:%}')
```

```
## d = decimal:     123
## f = fixed-point: 123.123000
## e = exponential: 1.231230e+02
## g = general:     123.123
## % = percentage:  12312.300000%
```

Number Widths
-------------
The **width** of a number, ie how many characters-worth of space it takes up, is specified by placing a number between the colon and the formatting option.

- The width of a number is equal to its number of digits, plus any decimal point/exponential sign/percent sign/etc it has, *plus any white space on either side of it*
- You cannot specify a width that is smaller than the minimum amount of space needed to display a number. If you do, Python will use the minimum needed width.
- If you specify a width that is larger than what the number needs, Python will fill up the extra space with white space (padding)

```{python, eval = FALSE}
answer = 123
print(f'd = decimal:     |{answer:1d}|{answer:9d}|{answer:15d}|')
answer = 123.123
print(f'f = fixed-point: |{answer:1f}|{answer:9f}|{answer:15f}|')
print(f'e = exponential: |{answer:1e}|{answer:9e}|{answer:15e}|')
print(f'g = general:     |{answer:1g}|{answer:9g}|{answer:15g}|')
print(f'% = percentage:  |{answer:1%}|{answer:9%}|{answer:15%}|')
```

```
## d = decimal:     |123|      123|            123|
## f = fixed-point: |123.123000|123.123000|     123.123000|
## e = exponential: |1.231230e+02|1.231230e+02|   1.231230e+02|
## g = general:     |123.123|  123.123|        123.123|
## % = percentage:  |12312.300000%|12312.300000%|  12312.300000%|
```

Decimal Places
--------------
The number of digits that get displayed after the decimal point can be specified by placing a full stop and the desired number between the width and the format options:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
answer = 123.123
print(f'f = fixed-point: |{answer:15.1f}|{answer:15.3f}|{answer:15.5f}|')
print(f'e = exponential: |{answer:15.1e}|{answer:15.3e}|{answer:15.5e}|')
print(f'g = general:     |{answer:15.1g}|{answer:15.3g}|{answer:15.5g}|')
print(f'% = percentage:  |{answer:15.1%}|{answer:15.3%}|{answer:15.5%}|')
```

```
## f = fixed-point: |          123.1|        123.123|      123.12300|
## e = exponential: |        1.2e+02|      1.231e+02|    1.23123e+02|
## g = general:     |          1e+02|            123|         123.12|
## % = percentage:  |       12312.3%|     12312.300%|   12312.30000%|
```

For obvious reasons, the decimal place modifier cannot be used with the "d" formatting option. Similarly, specifying more decimal places than the width will allow will be corrected by Python.

> Fully format a numerical f-string with: `{VariableName:Width.DecimalsFormat}`

Signed Numbers
--------------
Usually, negative numbers are shown like this:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
answer = -123
print(f'd = decimal:     |{answer:15d}|')
answer = -123.123
print(f'f = fixed-point: |{answer:15.1f}|{answer:15.3f}|{answer:15.5f}|')
print(f'e = exponential: |{answer:15.1e}|{answer:15.3e}|{answer:15.5e}|')
print(f'g = general:     |{answer:15.1g}|{answer:15.3g}|{answer:15.5g}|')
print(f'% = percentage:  |{answer:15.1%}|{answer:15.3%}|{answer:15.5%}|')
```

```
## d = decimal:     |           -123|
## f = fixed-point: |         -123.1|       -123.123|     -123.12300|
## e = exponential: |       -1.2e+02|     -1.231e+02|   -1.23123e+02|
## g = general:     |         -1e+02|           -123|        -123.12|
## % = percentage:  |      -12312.3%|    -12312.300%|  -12312.30000%|
```

To force the padding to be applied *after* the minus sign, prepend an equals sign to the formatting modifier:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
answer = -123
print(f'd = decimal:     |{answer:=15d}|')
answer = -123.123
print(f'f = fixed-point: |{answer:=15.1f}|{answer:=15.3f}|{answer:=15.5f}|')
print(f'e = exponential: |{answer:=15.1e}|{answer:=15.3e}|{answer:=15.5e}|')
print(f'g = general:     |{answer:=15.1g}|{answer:=15.3g}|{answer:=15.5g}|')
print(f'% = percentage:  |{answer:=15.1%}|{answer:=15.3%}|{answer:=15.5%}|')
```

```
## d = decimal:     |-           123|
## f = fixed-point: |-         123.1|-       123.123|-     123.12300|
## e = exponential: |-       1.2e+02|-     1.231e+02|-   1.23123e+02|
## g = general:     |-         1e+02|-           123|-        123.12|
## % = percentage:  |-      12312.3%|-    12312.300%|-  12312.30000%|
```

To show a sign regardless of whether the number is positive or negative, use the plus sign:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
answer = -123
print(f'd = decimal:     |{answer:+15d}|')
answer = 123.123
print(f'f = fixed-point: |{answer:+15.1f}|{answer:+15.3f}|{answer:+15.5f}|')
print(f'e = exponential: |{answer:+15.1e}|{answer:+15.3e}|{answer:+15.5e}|')
print(f'g = general:     |{answer:+15.1g}|{answer:+15.3g}|{answer:+15.5g}|')
print(f'% = percentage:  |{answer:+15.1%}|{answer:+15.3%}|{answer:+15.5%}|')
```

```
## d = decimal:     |           -123|
## f = fixed-point: |         +123.1|       +123.123|     +123.12300|
## e = exponential: |       +1.2e+02|     +1.231e+02|   +1.23123e+02|
## g = general:     |         +1e+02|           +123|        +123.12|
## % = percentage:  |      +12312.3%|    +12312.300%|  +12312.30000%|
```

To combine the above two and show the padding after the positive/negative sign, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative, use both an equals sign and a plus sign:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
answer = -123
print(f'd = decimal:     |{answer:=+15d}|')
answer = 123.123
print(f'f = fixed-point: |{answer:=+15.1f}|{answer:=+15.3f}|{answer:=+15.5f}|')
print(f'e = exponential: |{answer:=+15.1e}|{answer:=+15.3e}|{answer:=+15.5e}|')
print(f'g = general:     |{answer:=+15.1g}|{answer:=+15.3g}|{answer:=+15.5g}|')
print(f'% = percentage:  |{answer:=+15.1%}|{answer:=+15.3%}|{answer:=+15.5%}|')
```

```
## d = decimal:     |-           123|
## f = fixed-point: |+         123.1|+       123.123|+     123.12300|
## e = exponential: |+       1.2e+02|+     1.231e+02|+   1.23123e+02|
## g = general:     |+         1e+02|+           123|+        123.12|
## % = percentage:  |+      12312.3%|+    12312.300%|+  12312.30000%|
```

Additional Formatting
---------------------
Show leading zeros by prepending `0` to the formatting modifier:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
answer = 123
print(f'd = decimal:     |{answer:015d}|')
answer = 123.123
print(f'f = fixed-point: |{answer:015.1f}|{answer:015.3f}|{answer:015.5f}|')
print(f'e = exponential: |{answer:015.1e}|{answer:015.3e}|{answer:015.5e}|')
print(f'g = general:     |{answer:015.1g}|{answer:015.3g}|{answer:015.5g}|')
print(f'% = percentage:  |{answer:015.1%}|{answer:015.3%}|{answer:015.5%}|')
```

```
## d = decimal:     |000000000000123|
## f = fixed-point: |0000000000123.1|00000000123.123|000000123.12300|
## e = exponential: |000000001.2e+02|0000001.231e+02|00001.23123e+02|
## g = general:     |00000000001e+02|000000000000123|000000000123.12|
## % = percentage:  |000000012312.3%|0000012312.300%|00012312.30000%|
```

Have a thousands separator by using a comma in the formatting modifier:

```{python}
answer = 123456789.123
print(f'Thousands separator: |{answer:,.2f}|')
```

Formatting Strings
==================
Strings are handled similarly to numbers, although they are less complex. Strings are indicated with the "s" formatting option:

```{python}
first = 'Hello'
second = 'World'
print(f'Simple: |{first:s}|{second:s}|')
```

Specifying a width can create padding (note that strings are left-aligned by default, whereas numbers are right-aligned):

```{python}
print(f'Padding: |{first:20s}|{second:10s}|')
```

Specifying a 'precision' will truncate the string:

```{python}
print(f'Truncating: |{first:.2s}|{second:.3s}|')
```

Of course, truncating and padding can be combined:

```{python}
print(f'Truncating & padding: |{first:15.2s}|{second:10.3s}|')
```

Converting to Strings
---------------------
A number can always be converted to a string using the `str()` function. There may be some circumstances where that helps you with formatting:

```{python}
answer = 1234
print(f'A number: {str(answer)}')
```

However, this conversion from number to string can actually be done automatically by an f-string using "!s":

```{python, eval = FALSE}
print(f'Call str() using !s:               |{answer!s}|')
print(f'Call str() using !s, with padding: |{answer!s:6}|')
```

```
## Call str() using !s:               |1234|
## Call str() using !s, with padding: |1234  |
```

This works for Booleans too:

```{python}
first = True
second = False
print(f'Call str() on Booleans: |{first!s:8}|{second!s:8}|')
```

Formatting Dates
================
Things such as `datetime` objects can also be formatted within the curly brackets of an f-string. Here's an example of a normal (unformatted) `datetime` object (more info about these can be found on the [Date and Time page](../advanced/datetime.html)):

```{python}
from datetime import datetime

dt = datetime(2012, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

print(dt)
```

These can be formatted by adding a date format code as a string after the colon:

```{python}
dt = datetime(2012, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

print(f'{dt:%Hh%M on %d %B %Y}')
```

For more info about date format codes, see the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes).

Alignment
=========
By default, strings get left-aligned and numbers get right-aligned. This can be controlled explicitly by using the "<", ">" and "^" characters:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
first = 'String'
second = 123.456
print(f'Default: |{first:16s}|{second:16.2f}|')
print(f'Left:    |{first:<16s}|{second:<16.2f}|')
print(f'Right:   |{first:>16s}|{second:>16.2f}|')
print(f'Centred: |{first:^16s}|{second:^16.2f}|')
```

```
## Default: |String          |          123.46|
## Left:    |String          |123.46          |
## Right:   |          String|          123.46|
## Centred: |     String     |     123.46     |
```

```{python, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Using Explicit Values
# =====================
# It's actually not necessary to use variables in f-strings; the values can be coded explicitly:

{python}
print(f'String: {'Hello, World':10s}')
print(f'String: {'Explicit string':<20s}')
answer = 123.45678
print(f'{answer:^6.2f}')
print(f'Float: {123.45678:6.2f}')
```

Lists
=====
You can format an entire list of objects by using a combination of f-strings, list comprehension and the `.join()` method:

```{python}
ls = [
    6.28318,
    2.71828,
    0.57721,
    9.81,
    6.67430,
]
# The formatter ".0f" will round to the nearest whole number
print('\n'.join(f'{v:.0f}' for v in ls))
```

Cheat Sheet
===========
The general form of a standard format specifier is:

<font size="5">
<center>
`[[fill]align][sign][#][0][width][,][.precision][type]`
</center>
</font>

Take a look at the explanatory table below or [here](https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/functions/format.html) for more details.

| Field | Description | Values | Default |
|-------|-------------|--------|---------|
| fill  | What character to fill 'white space' padding with | Any character | Space |
| align | Align the object left, right or centrally  | "<", ">", "=", "^" | "<" (strings), ">" (numbers) |
| sign  | How positives, negatives, bases and thousands get treated | "+", "-", " ", "#", "," | "-" |
| width | The minimum field width | Any positive integer | The variable's width |
| precision | How many digits should be displayed after the decimal point/how long the string must be | Any positive integer | The precision of the number/length of the string |
| type | How the data should be presented | "b", "c", "d", "e", "E", "f", "F", "g", "G", "n", "o", "s", "x", "X", "%" | "s", "d", "g" |
