> This page is about the *unpaired* two one-sided *t*-tests procedure ('unpaired TOST'). The *paired* two one-sided *t*-tests procedure ('paired TOST') is covered on [this page](tost_paired.html).

The unpaired TOST can be used to test **equivalence**: do the means of two populations differ by less than a given amount?

- In reality, we don't *actually* use the means of two population because, of course, it's (usually) not practical to measure every member of an entire population. For this reason we take a **sample** from each and compare the means of those.
- These populations and samples should be **independent** of each other: a change in one of them should not affect any of the others
- We assume that the values in the populations are **normally distributed**

The test was originally published by Donald J Schuirmann<sup>1, 2</sup> (not Donald **L** Schuirmann as appears in the [R](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/equivalence/versions/0.7.2/topics/tost.stat) and [Pingouin](https://pingouin-stats.org/build/html/generated/pingouin.tost.html) documentation).

Statistical Hypotheses
======================
At first glance, a research question such as "do the means of two populations differ by less than a given amount?" suggests the following pair of hypotheses:

- $H_0:\ \mu_x - \mu_y \geq \delta$
- $H_1:\ \mu_x - \mu_y \lt \delta$

where $\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$ are the means of the two populations and $\delta$ is the tolerance you've decided on. However, we need to remember that we can't assume that $\mu_x$ is larger than $\mu_y$, and so the difference between them (if one exists) might be negative! We thus need to have a second set of hypotheses to cover this possibility:

- $H_0:\ \mu_x - \mu_y \leq -\delta$
- $H_1:\ \mu_x - \mu_y \gt -\delta$

This is why it's called the **two** one-sided *t*-tests procedure: the fact that you have two pairs of hypotheses means that you need to do the one-sided *t*-test **twice**. It is also why, ultimately, you only choose the result of one of these *t*-tests as your final answer: it's because you only care about the one where the difference between the means has the same sign as $\delta$.

Example One: Pingouin
=====================
This comes from [the documentation](https://pingouin-stats.org/build/html/generated/pingouin.tost.html) for Pingouin's `tost()` function. Here's the example data:

```{python}
# Example data
a = [4, 7, 8, 6, 3, 2]
b = [6, 8, 7, 10, 11, 9]
```

Doing it with Pingouin
----------------------
The Pingouin package gives you access to the `tost()` function which, as the name suggests, performs the TOST. It can be installed from the terminal with:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
python3.11 -m pip install pingouin
```

Replace `3.11` with whichever version of Python you have installed and are using. If you see a message saying `OutdatedPackageWarning: The package pingouin is out of date.` it means you need to update (upgrade) Pingouin. Do this from the terminal with:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
python3.11 -m pip install pingouin --upgrade
```

As mentioned, the TOST asks "do the means of two populations differ by less than a given amount?". This given amount is called the 'bound' and, by default, Pingouin gives it a value of 1:

```{python}
import pingouin as pg

pval = pg.tost(a, b).loc['TOST', 'pval']

print(f'TOST: p = {pval:.3f}')
```

If you're interested in seeing exactly what this function is doing in the background, you can take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/raphaelvallat/pingouin/blob/master/pingouin/equivalence.py).

Doing it with SciPy
-------------------
While SciPy doesn't have a dedicated TOST function, it does have the *t*-test. So we can use that twice in its 'one-sided' configuration. Specifically, we're using the unpaired (independent) two-sample *t*-test:

```{python}
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

#
# TOST
#
# Magnitude of region of similarity
bound = 1
# Unpaired two-sample t-test
_, p_greater = stats.ttest_ind(np.array(a) + bound, b, alternative='greater')
_, p_less = stats.ttest_ind(np.array(a) - bound, b, alternative='less')
# Choose the maximum p-value
pval = max(p_less, p_greater)

print(f'TOST: p = {pval:5.3f}')
```

As expected, this gives us the same answer as Pingouin.

SciPy and Numpy can be installed from the terminal with:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
python3.11 -m pip install scipy
python3.11 -m pip install numpy
```

Again, `3.11` should be the version of Python you have installed and are using.

Doing it Explicitly
-------------------
To see what is going on in the background in more detail, here's the same result obtained in more steps:

```{python}
# Sample means
mean_a = np.mean(a)
mean_b = np.mean(b)
# Sample sizes
sample_size_a = len(a)
sample_size_b = len(b)
# Sample variances
var_a = np.var(a, ddof=1)
var_b = np.var(b, ddof=1)
# Pooled sample variance (ie we assume equal variances)
var_p = ((sample_size_a - 1) * var_a + (sample_size_b - 1) * var_b) / (sample_size_a + sample_size_b - 2)
# Pooled sample standard deviation
std_p = np.sqrt(var_p)
# t-Values
bound = 1
t_1 = (mean_a - mean_b + bound) / np.sqrt(var_p / sample_size_a + var_p / sample_size_b)
t_2 = (mean_a - mean_b - bound) / np.sqrt(var_p / sample_size_a + var_p / sample_size_b)
# Degrees of freedom
dof = sample_size_a + sample_size_b - 2
# Critical values of the t distribution
alpha_1 = 0.05
t_crit_1 = stats.t.ppf(1 - alpha_1, dof)
alpha_2 = 1 - alpha_1
t_crit_2 = stats.t.ppf(1 - alpha_2, dof)
# Test the t-statistics against the t-values required for significance
if (t_1 > t_crit_1) and (t_2 < t_crit_2):
    print('Reject both null hypotheses; the means of the two samples are equivalent')
else:
    print('Fail to reject both null hypotheses; the means of the two samples are not equivalent')
```

Example Two: Real Statistics
============================
This example comes from [here](https://www.real-statistics.com/students-t-distribution/equivalence-testing-tost/) and uses this data:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'values': [
        2311, 2274, 2262, 2297, 2291, 2319, 2263, 2329, 2289, 2287, 2290, 2301,
        2298, 2260, 2250, 2242, 2302, 2297, 2293, 2286, 2270, 2313, 2327, 2290,
    ],
    'types': ['original'] * 12 + ['new'] * 12
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

Pandas can be installed from the terminal with:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
python3.11 -m pip install pandas
```

Summary Statistics
------------------
Here's how to replicate the values in the top table of Figure 1 in [the example](https://www.real-statistics.com/students-t-distribution/equivalence-testing-tost/):

```{python}
# Initialise the summary table
summary = pd.DataFrame()

# Count
n = df.groupby('types').count()
summary['Count'] = n['values']
# Mean
summary['Mean'] = df.groupby('types').mean()['values']
# Variance
summary['Variance'] = df.groupby('types').var()['values']

print(summary.round(2))
```

```{python}
# Difference of the means
diff_mean = df.groupby('types').mean().diff().values[1][0]
print(f'Difference of the means = {diff_mean:.3f}')
```

```{python}
# Mean variance
mean_var = df.groupby('types').var().mean().values[0]
print(f'Mean variance = {mean_var:.3f}')
```

```{python}
# Cohen's d
cohens_d = diff_mean / np.sqrt(mean_var)
print(f"Cohen's d = {cohens_d:.3f}")
```

*t*-Test: Equal Variances
-------------------------
Here's how to replicate the values in the middle table of Figure 1 in [the example](https://www.real-statistics.com/students-t-distribution/equivalence-testing-tost/):

```{python}
# Standard deviations
std = df.groupby('types').std(ddof=1)
# Standard errors of the means
sem = std / np.sqrt(df.groupby('types').mean())
# Standard error of the difference of the means
sed = np.sqrt(std['values']['new']**2 / n['values']['new'] + std['values']['original']**2 / n['values']['original'])

print(f'Standard error of the difference of the means = {sed:.3f}')
```

```{python}
# Degrees of freedom
dof = n.sum() - 2
print(f"Degrees of freedom = {dof['values']}")
```

Now it's time to do the *t*-tests. Let's re-configure the raw data so it's slightly easier to work with:

```{python}
# Data frame to dictionary
dct = df.groupby('types')['values'].apply(list).to_dict()
# Data
x = dct['original']
y = dct['new']
```

The example we're following does both a one-tailed and a two-tailed test, where the one-tailed test has a bound of 0 (which they call the 'hyp mean' or 'hypothetical difference of the means') and an alternative hypothesis of 'greater':

```{python}
# One-sided unpaired two-sample t-test
bound = 0
t_greater, p_greater = stats.ttest_ind(np.array(x) + bound, y, alternative='greater')

print(f't-stat = {t_greater:.3f}; p-value = {p_greater:.3f}')
```

```{python}
# Two-sided unpaired two-sample t-test
bound = 0
t_stat, pval = stats.ttest_ind(x, y, alternative='two-sided')

print(f't-stat = {t_stat:.3f}; p-value = {pval:.3f}')
```

> Note that using a bound of 0 is not practical: if your research question is asking if the difference between the means of two groups is between +0 and -0 you should rather be testing for equivalence! In other words, you should be using a single two-sample *t*-test, not the TOST (which, remember, is *two* two-sample *t*-tests). This is actually what the example is doing, but it's not very clear!

If we use a significance level of 0.1, here are the critical *t*-values we would need to reach in order to get significance:

```{python}
# Significance level
alpha = 0.1
# Percent-point function (aka quantile function) of the t-distribution
t_crit_one = stats.t.ppf(1 - alpha, dof)[0]
print(f't-crit (one-tailed): {t_crit_one:.3f}')
```

```{python}
# Percent-point function (aka quantile function) of the t-distribution
t_crit_two = stats.t.ppf(1 - (alpha / 2), dof)[0]
print(f't-crit (two-tailed): {t_crit_two:.3f}')
```

Now for the confidence interval for the difference of the means (the fact that we're finding an interval that extends *both* sides of the difference of the means implies we need to use the critical *t*-value from the *two-sided* test):

```{python}
# Margin of error
d = t_crit_two * sed
# Confidence interval
ci_upper = diff_mean + d
ci_lower = diff_mean - d

print(f'Difference of the means = {diff_mean:.3f} 95% CI [{ci_lower:.3f}, {ci_upper:.3f}]')
```

Final Answer
------------
[The example](https://www.real-statistics.com/students-t-distribution/equivalence-testing-tost/) only shows one one-sided *t*-test for equal variances in Figure 1, which is only one-half of the full TOST. Here's the full thing with a bound of 25:

```{python}
#
# TOST
#
# Magnitude of region of similarity
bound = 25
# Unpaired two-sample t-test
_, p_greater = stats.ttest_ind(np.array(x) + bound, y, alternative='greater')
_, p_less = stats.ttest_ind(np.array(x) - bound, y, alternative='less')
# Choose the maximum p-value
pval = max(p_less, p_greater)

print(f'TOST: p = {pval:5.3f}')
```

Here it is with Pingouin:

```{python}
pval = pg.tost(x, y, bound=25).loc['TOST', 'pval']

print(f'TOST: p = {pval:.3f}')
```

This p-value of 0.036 matches that obtained in the example (although this isn't shown in the figure, it's in the text).

Doing it Explicitly
-------------------
Once again, here's the same result obtained in more steps:

```{python}
# Sample
a = [2311, 2274, 2262, 2297, 2291, 2319, 2263, 2329, 2289, 2287, 2290, 2301]
b = [2298, 2260, 2250, 2242, 2302, 2297, 2293, 2286, 2270, 2313, 2327, 2290]

# Sample means
mean_a = np.mean(a)
mean_b = np.mean(b)
# Sample sizes
sample_size_a = len(a)
sample_size_b = len(b)
# Sample variances
var_a = np.var(a, ddof=1)
var_b = np.var(b, ddof=1)
# Pooled sample variance (ie we assume equal variances)
var_p = ((sample_size_a - 1) * var_a + (sample_size_b - 1) * var_b) / (sample_size_a + sample_size_b - 2)
# Pooled sample standard deviation
std_p = np.sqrt(var_p)
# t-Values
bound = 25
t_1 = (mean_a - mean_b + bound) / np.sqrt(var_p / sample_size_a + var_p / sample_size_b)
t_2 = (mean_a - mean_b - bound) / np.sqrt(var_p / sample_size_a + var_p / sample_size_b)
# Degrees of freedom
dof = sample_size_a + sample_size_b - 2
# Critical values of the t distribution
alpha_1 = 0.05
t_crit_1 = stats.t.ppf(1 - alpha_1, dof)
alpha_2 = 1 - alpha_1
t_crit_2 = stats.t.ppf(1 - alpha_2, dof)
# Test the t-statistics against the t-values required for significance
if (t_1 > t_crit_1) and (t_2 < t_crit_2):
    print('Reject both null hypotheses; the means of the two samples are equivalent')
else:
    print('Fail to reject both null hypotheses; the means of the two samples are not equivalent')
```
