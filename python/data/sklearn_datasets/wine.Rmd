For more info, see here:

The **wine recognition dataset** is loaded using `load_wine()`. This
returns a 'Bunch' object with the following keys:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DESCR` | Description of the dataset |
| `feature_names` | Names of the 13 groups of data |
| `data` | The 178 data points in each of the 13 groups of data, formatted as a 150x13 array |
| `target_names` | Names of the target data (ie the 3 wine cultivators) |
| `target` | Which group each data point is in (0, 1 or 2) |

```{python}
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine

# Load the dataset
wine = load_wine()

# Show the dataset's keys
print(list(wine))
```

```{python}
# Description of the dataset
print(wine['DESCR'])
```

```{python}
# Names of the 13 groups of data
print(wine['feature_names'])
```

```{python}
# The 178 data points in each of the 13 groups of data, formatted as a 150x13 array
print(wine['data'][:2])
```

```{python}
# Names of the target data (ie the 3 wine cultivators)
print(wine['target_names'])
```

```{python}
# Which group each data point is in (0, 1 or 2)
print(wine['target'])
```

The groups of data can be plotted against each other or against the target
group as follows:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# PLOT
plt.scatter(wine['data'][:, 0], wine['data'][:, 9], c=wine['target'])
plt.title('Wine recognition dataset')
plt.xlabel(wine['feature_names'][0])
plt.ylabel(wine['feature_names'][9])
plt.show()
```

The data is much easier to work with if it is converted to a data frame:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# CONVERT TO DATA FRAME
wine_df = pd.DataFrame(wine['data'], columns=wine['feature_names'])
wine_df['Cultivator'] = wine['target']

# PLOT
plt.scatter(
    wine_df['hue'], wine_df['malic_acid'],
    c=wine_df['Cultivator']
)
plt.title('Wine recognition dataset')
plt.xlabel('hue')
plt.ylabel('malic_acid')
plt.show()
```
