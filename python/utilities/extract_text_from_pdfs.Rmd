```

Text can be extracted from PDF documents using the [pypdf](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf) library. Install this from the terminal with the following command (replace "3.11" with the version of Python you have):

```
$ python3.11 -m pip install pypdf
```

As an example of a PDF from which to extract text let's use Bland and Altman's 1986 paper "Statistical methods for assessing agreement between two methods of clinical measurement" (the [29th most-cited paper](https://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224) of all time). It can be downloaded from [here](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/meas/ba.pdf) or from Bland's [own site](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/index.html).

Once you've downloaded the PDF, create a Python script in the same folder and you'll be able to use pypdf from there:

```{python}
from pypdf import PdfReader

# Download this PDF from https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/meas/ba.pdf
pdf = PdfReader('ba.pdf')
```

Once imported into Python, the number of pages in the PDF can be accessed as an attribute:

```{python}
number_of_pages = len(pdf.pages)

print(f'Number of pages in this PDF: {number_of_pages}')
```

Access the first page, extract the text and split it into individual lines:

```{python}
page = pdf.pages[0]
text = page.extract_text()
lines = text.split('\n')

for line in lines[:3]:
    print(line)
```

You'll notice that the page number appears at the start of the first line. This is annoying, but it's a manageable glitch.

Next, let's access the raw data on page 2:

```{python}
page = pdf.pages[1]
text = page.extract_text()
lines = text.split('\n')

for line in lines[1:21]:
    print(line)
```

This is great, we can import the data into Python directly from the PDF! Of course, it will be more usable in a data frame format, so let's import Pandas and re-structure it:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Initialise the output data frame
df = pd.DataFrame()
# Iterate over the lines extracted from the PDF
for line in lines[4:21]:
    # Remove duplicate white space
    line = ' '.join(line.split())
    # Split into its elements
    line = line.split()
    # Construct a new row with a MultiIndex as the column names
    data = [[line[1], line[2], line[3], line[4]]]
    arrays = [
        ['Wright'] * 2 + ['Mini Wright'] * 2,
        ['First', 'Second'] * 2,
    ]
    tuples = list(zip(*arrays))
    columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(tuples)
    new_row = pd.DataFrame(data, index=[line[0]], columns=columns)
    # Add to master data frame
    df = pd.concat([df, new_row])

print(df)
```
