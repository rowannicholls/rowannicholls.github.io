#### *A pre-loaded example dataset in R*
Main page: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/crimtab

```{r}
head(crimtab)
require(stats)
dim(crimtab)
utils::str(crimtab)
## for nicer printing:
local({cT <- crimtab
       colnames(cT) <- substring(colnames(cT), 2, 3)
       print(cT, zero.print = " ")
})

## Repeat Student's experiment:

# 1) Reconstitute 3000 raw data for heights in inches and rounded to
#    nearest integer as in Student's paper:

(heIn <- round(as.numeric(colnames(crimtab)) / 2.54))
d.hei <- data.frame(height = rep(heIn, colSums(crimtab)))

# 2) shuffle the data:

set.seed(1)
d.hei <- d.hei[sample(1:3000), , drop = FALSE]

# 3) Make 750 samples each of size 4:

d.hei$sample <- as.factor(rep(1:750, each = 4))

# 4) Compute the means and standard deviations (n) for the 750 samples:

h.mean <- with(d.hei, tapply(height, sample, FUN = mean))
h.sd   <- with(d.hei, tapply(height, sample, FUN = sd)) * sqrt(3/4)

# 5) Compute the difference between the mean of each sample and
#    the mean of the population and then divide by the
#    standard deviation of the sample:

zobs <- (h.mean - mean(d.hei[,"height"]))/h.sd

# 6) Replace infinite values by +/- 6 as in Student's paper:

zobs[infZ <- is.infinite(zobs)] # none of them 
zobs[infZ] <- 6 * sign(zobs[infZ])

# 7) Plot the distribution:

require(grDevices); require(graphics)
hist(x = zobs, probability = TRUE, xlab = "Student's z",
     col = grey(0.8), border = grey(0.5),
     main = "Distribution of Student's z score  for 'crimtab' data")
```
