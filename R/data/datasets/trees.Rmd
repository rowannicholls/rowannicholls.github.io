#### *A pre-loaded example dataset in R*
Main page: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/trees

```{r}
trees
require(stats); require(graphics)
pairs(trees, panel = panel.smooth, main = "trees data")
plot(Volume ~ Girth, data = trees, log = "xy")
coplot(log(Volume) ~ log(Girth) | Height, data = trees,
       panel = panel.smooth)
summary(fm1 <- lm(log(Volume) ~ log(Girth), data = trees))
summary(fm2 <- update(fm1, ~ . + log(Height), data = trees))
step(fm2)
## i.e., Volume ~= c * Height * Girth^2  seems reasonable
```
