#### *A pre-loaded example dataset in R*
Main page: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/infert

```{r}
head(infert)
require(stats)
model1 <- glm(case ~ spontaneous+induced, data = infert, family = binomial())
summary(model1)
## adjusted for other potential confounders:
summary(model2 <- glm(case ~ age+parity+education+spontaneous+induced,
                     data = infert, family = binomial()))
## Really should be analysed by conditional logistic regression
## which is in the survival package
if(require(survival)){
  model3 <- clogit(case ~ spontaneous+induced+strata(stratum), data = infert)
  print(summary(model3))
  detach()  # survival (conflicts)
}
```
