# Arithmetic
All the usual mathematical operations can be done in R:

```{r}
# Addition and subtraction
a = 4 + 5 - 2
# Multiplication and division
b = 2 * 100 / 4
# Integer division
c = 47 %/% 5
# Exponent
d = 2 ^ 4
# Modulus
e = 5 %% 13

# Output to console
c(a, b, c, d, e)
```

For more complicated operations, there are functions to do it for you:

```{r}
# Square root
a = sqrt(49)
# Round down
b = floor(-3.14159)
# Round up
c = ceiling(-3.14159)
# Round towards zero
d = trunc(-3.14159)
# Round to a certain number of decimal points
e = round(-3.14159, 3)
# Round to a certain number of significant figures
f = signif(-3.14159, 3)

# Output to console
c(a, b, c, d, e, f)

# Remove trailing zeros
# Note that this converts the number to a string
g = prettyNum(-3.14000, zero.print=NULL)
g
```
