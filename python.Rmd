## Working with Data
[Example Datasets from Scikit-Learn](python/data/sklearn_datasets.html)

## Graphs (using Matplotlib)
1. [Image Size](python/graphs/image_size.html)
2. [Latex in Labels](python/graphs/latex_in_labels.html)
3. Graphing using `pyplot` (quicker for simple plots but gives you less control over how they look)
    - Box Plots (aka box-and-whisker plots)
        + One Group of Data
        + Multiple Groups of Data
    + Bar Plots
        + One Group of Data
        + Multiple Groups of Data
4. Graphing using `axes` (more complicated but gives you more control)
    - Box Plots (aka box-and-whisker plots)
        + [One Group of Data](python/graphs/ax_based/boxplots_single_group.html)
        + [Multiple Groups of Data](python/graphs/ax_based/boxplots_multiple_groups.html)
    + Bar Plots
        + [One Group of Data](python/graphs/ax_based/barplots_single_group.html)
        + Multiple Groups of Data
    - [Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves](python/graphs/ax_based/roc_curves.html)

## Statistics
1. [Chi-Squared Tests](python/statistics/chi_squared.html)
