**Structured Query Language** (SQL) - pronounced "*es cue el*", not "*sequel*" - is a programming language used to manage data in a database.

SQLite
======
SQL is not a programme itself but it is used in many programmes, one of the most accessible of which is SQLite[^1]. This is a database *engine* - software that allows users to change the data in a database - that uses the SQL language[^2]. It stores the database in a single file on your local machine and can be run offline from your terminal, which makes it very simple for small projects and for beginners.

[^1]: Technically, SQLite is not a programme but a library (ie it is embedded in fully-fledged programmes).&nbsp;
[^2]: Also, technically, SQLite uses 'PostgreSQL' which is an extension of SQL. The distinction between PostgreSQL and SQL (as well as the distinction between a library and a programme) is irrelevant for this page.&nbsp;

Install SQLite from the terminal with:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ sudo apt install sqlite3
```

You can then open it with the following (but beware that you will be working in 'memory' as opposed to having what you do be saved to a file):

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ sqlite3
```

Usually you will want to have your work be saved to a file. To launch SQLite and create a new database file (or open an existing database file if you specify the name of one that already exists) the command is as follows:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ sqlite3 database_name.db
```

Usage
=====
Here is a cheat sheet that covers most of the common functionality of SQL:

Databases
---------
- Create database:  
`CREATE DATABASE database_name;`
- Show databases:  
`SHOW DATABASES;`
- Delete a database:  
`DROP DATABASE database_name;`
- Select a database:  
`USE database_name;`

Tables
------
- Create a new table:  
    - With multiple columns:  
    `CREATE TABLE table_name(column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, column_3 data_type);`  
    Possible data types that can be used:
        - `INTEGER`: a whole number
        - `REAL`: a decimal number
        - `TEXT`: a string of text characters. Quotation marks are needed.
        - `DATE`: a date (in YYYY-MM-DD format). Quotation marks are needed.
    - Use a 'primary key' column to uniquely identify each row:  
    `CREATE TABLE table_name(column_1 data_type PRIMARY KEY);`
    - Prevent nulls for being added:  
    `CREATE TABLE table_name(column_1 data_type NOT NULL);`
    - Prevent duplicates from being added:  
    `CREATE TABLE table_name(column_1 data_type UNIQUE);`
    - Define a default value which gets used if nothing else is specified:  
    `CREATE TABLE table_name(column_1 data_type DEFAULT 'default_value');`
- Show all tables:  
`SHOW TABLES;`
- Delete a table:  
`DROP TABLE table_name;`

Rows
----
- Create and populate a new row:  
    - Create a new row with a value in one column (other columns will be filled with NULL):  
    `INSERT INTO table_name(column_name) VALUES(value);`
    - Create a new row with values in three columns:  
    `INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2, column_3) VALUES(value_1, value_2, value_3);`
- Edit a row:  
`UPDATE table_name SET column_1 = new_value WHERE column_2 = value;`
- Delete a row:  
`DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column_name = value;`

Columns
-------
- Create a new column:  
`ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN new_column data_type;`
- Rename a column:  
`ALTER TABLE column_1 RENAME TO column_2;`

Show a Table
------------
- Show one column:  
`SELECT column_name FROM table_name;`
- Show some columns:  
`SELECT column_1, column_2, column_3 FROM table_name;`
- Show all columns:  
`SELECT * FROM table_name;`
- Show all columns, some rows:  
`SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10;`
- Select and assign an alias to the selection:  
`SELECT column_name AS 'alias' FROM table_name;`
- Filter a table:
    - Filter out duplicates:  
    `SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;`
    - Filter out NULLs from one column:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;`
    - Filter using one column and comparisons operators:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name > value;`  
    The comparisons operators are:
        - `=`: equal to
        - `!=`: not equal to
        - `>`: greater than
        - `<`: less than
        - `>=`: greater than or equal to
        - `<=`: less than or equal to
    - Filter using one column to get a range:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value_1 AND value_2;`
    - Filter using two columns and conditionals:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_1 > value AND column_2 < value;`  
    `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_1 BETWEEN value_1 AND value_2 AND column_2 > value_3;`  
    `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_1 BETWEEN value_1 AND value_2 OR column_2 > value_3;`  
    The possible conditionals are:
        - `AND`
        - `OR`
    - Filter using matching:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'te_t';`  
    `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE '%substring%';`
- Sort a table:  
    - Sort ascending/alphabetically:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;`
    - Sort descending/reverse alphabetically:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name DESC;`
- Filter and sort a table:  
`SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_1 > value ORDER BY column_2 DESC;`
- Round the values in a column:  
`SELECT column_1, ROUND(column_2, num_decimal_places) FROM table_name;`
- Aggregates (return one value):  
    - Count rows:  
    `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;`  
    `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name WHERE column_name = value;`
    - Add up values:  
    `SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;`  
    `SELECT SUM(column_1) FROM table_name WHERE column_2 = value;`
    - Find the maximum value:  
    `SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;`  
    `SELECT MAX(column_1) FROM table_name WHERE column_2 = value;`
    - Find the minimum value:  
    `SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;`  
    `SELECT MIN(column_1) FROM table_name WHERE column_2 = value;`
    - Find the average value:  
    `SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;`  
    `SELECT AVG(column_1) FROM table_name WHERE column_2 = value;`
- Group by (pivot table):  
    - Show all columns:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name;`
    - Show average for each group and sort them:  
    `SELECT column_1, AVG(column_2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_1 ORDER BY column_1;`  
    - When multiple columns are selected, you can refer to them by name:  
    `SELECT column_1, AVG(column_2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_1 ORDER BY column_1;`
    - ...or, you can just refer to them by number (`1` is the first column selected, `2` is the second, etc):  
    `SELECT column_1, AVG(column_2) FROM table_name GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;`
    - Filter values, then get the average for each group:  
    `SELECT column_1, AVG(column_2) FROM table_name WHERE column_3 > value GROUP BY column_1 ORDER BY column_1;`
    - Get the average for each group, then filter by these average:  
    `SELECT column_1, COUNT(column_2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_1 HAVING COUNT(column_2) > value;`

Join Tables
-----------
- Join via an inner join:  
    - Join two tables and select all columns:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_1 JOIN table_2 ON table_1.column_1 = table_2.column_1;`
    - Join two tables and select one column from each:  
    `SELECT table_1.column_2, table_2.column_3 FROM table_1 JOIN table_2 ON table_1.column_1 = table_2.column_1;`
    - Join two tables and filter:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_1 JOIN table_2 ON table_1.column_1 = table_2.column_1 WHERE column_2 = value;`
- Join via a left join:  
    - Join two tables and select all columns:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_1 LEFT JOIN table_2 ON table_1.column_1 = table_2.column_1;`
- Join via an outer join (cross join; no `ON` statement is required):  
    - Join two tables and select all columns:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_1 CROSS JOIN table_2;`
    - Join two tables and select one column from each:  
    `SELECT table_1.column_1, table_2.column_2 FROM table_1 CROSS JOIN table_2;`
- Append a table to the bottom of another:  
    - Append a table to another and select all columns from both:  
    `SELECT * FROM table_1 UNION SELECT * FROM table_2;`

Cases
-----
```{sql, eval = FALSE}
SELECT column_1
 CASE
  WHEN column_2 = 5 THEN 'Great'
  WHEN column_2 >= 4 THEN 'Good'
  WHEN column_2 >= 3 THEN 'Average'
  WHEN column_2 >= 2 THEN 'Ok'
  ELSE 'Poor'
 END AS 'new_column_name'
FROM table_name;
```

Statements inside Statements
----------------------------
```{sql, eval = FALSE}
WITH previous_results AS (
   SELECT column_1 AS 'alias' FROM table_1 UNION SELECT * FROM table_2
)
SELECT * FROM previous_results JOIN table_3 ON table_3.column_2 = previous_query.alias;
```
