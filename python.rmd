## Graphs (using Matplotlib)
1. [Image Size](python/graphs/image_size.html)
2. [Latex in Labels](python/graphs/latex_in_labels.html)
3. Graphing using `pyplot` (quicker for simple plots but gives you less control over how they look)
    - Boxplots (aka box-and-whisker plots)
4. Graphing using `axes` (more complicated but gives you more more control)
    - Boxplots (aka box-and-whisker plots)
